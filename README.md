# Game Engine Speed Run

A personal study comparing various game engines, which I've decided to share openly. Dive in to explore implementations of the same platformer game across different engines.

## 📌 Motivation

The gaming industry is ever-evolving, and choosing the right engine can make all the difference. This project was born out of curiosity to see how different engines handle the same game design.

## 🎮 Game Description

The game in focus is a simple 2D platformer where the player aims to reach the end of each level, overcoming obstacles and enemies.

## 🛠️ Methodology

Each engine will be used to recreate the same game level, aiming to keep the design and gameplay as consistent as possible. By comparing the implementation across each engine, we hope to pinpoint their respective strengths and limitations.
