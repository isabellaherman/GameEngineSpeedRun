# Game Engine Speed Run

A personal study comparing various game engines, which I've decided to share openly. Dive in to explore implementations of the same platformer game across different engines. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

## 📌 Motivation

Originating from a playful [tweet](https://twitter.com/isahermanx/status/1701958922767102227), this project has grown into a personal challenge. I wanted to explore and understand how different game engines handle the same platformer game concept. Recognizing the genuine interest from the game development community, I thought it best to document and share this experiment. It's an opportunity to learn, compare, and maybe even spark new ideas.


## 🎮 Game Description

The game in focus is a simple 2D platformer where the player aims to reach the end of each level, overcoming obstacles and enemies.

## 🛠️ Methodology

Each engine will be used to recreate the same game level, aiming to keep the design and gameplay as consistent as possible. By comparing the implementation across each engine, we hope to pinpoint their respective strengths and limitations.
