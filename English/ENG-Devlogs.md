# Hey there! 🌟

First things first: thanks for stopping by! This "Devlogs" space is my digital diary during the "Game Engine Speed Run" project. I wanted a space where I could give a more visual, step-by-step insight into my journey through different game engines. It's not about which one is the best, but about understanding their unique quirks and features.

Now, for the process:

- **Consistency is key!** I'll be recreating the same game level in each engine. While the level design remains constant, the art might differ slightly due to specific requirements of certain engines. 

- **⏳ Time Tracking:** I'll be using the Pomodoro technique to track my work, and you'll see little 🍅 emojis to represent that. Each 🍅 stands for a 25-minute work session.

### How to Read the Emojis:

- **🌕 Full Moon:** Clear and easy-to-understand documentation.
- **🌗 Half Moon:** Documentation was okay, but some areas were cloudy.
- **🌑 New Moon:** Difficult to understand or very lacking documentation.
- **💼 Professional Touch:** The engine has tools or features that seem particularly geared towards professional game development.
- **🎨 Artist Friendly:** The engine has tools or features that are beneficial for both artists and non-artists.
- **🤖 Programmer Oriented:** The engine seems more geared towards those with a programming background.

> **Note:** The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where work is broken into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato). Hence, the 🍅 emoji!

Enjoy the read, and feel free to reach out if you have any thoughts or questions!
